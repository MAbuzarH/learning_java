history
1968 www was created (DARP)
1970 first 5 node was established 
1974 TCP by vint cerf
http original web communication protocol
->request responce model
client (browser)
server
http:
statless:
does not maintain any connection information between transition information
feature:
negoseation of data representation allowing system to build independently of the data being transferred.
TCP/IP:
transmition control protocol over internet protocol
Ip ensures that data packets reach the destination from the source of communication
not  necessarily data packets follow the same path
TCP keeps tracks of these packets and manages the assembling of these packets to form the original message thus both TCP and IP work together to ensure that active transmission of data over the internet.
divide programe into layers eg data layer all the code which interact with database is stored in this layer
tears: how many server do you deploied your website 
thin client model: all processing is done on server client is there only to display data.
fat client model: client also do some processing
3tr moder: client -> server(Aplication process)->server(data menegement) 
sons micro systems  
fist name was ock then java  
java execution:
java code -> intermadeate state (java byte code)"this run on java virtual matchine" -> matchene code 
public static void main(string args[]){}
void main is a function public means that we can access it outside the class static means we need not to create an object first and then call function we directly call it and functionis used inside the class. args is an array of argument provided at start of program
primitve data types pass by value and objects pass by refrence

creation 1991
made by: jams   Gasling
j2SE ->core java
J2EE ->enterprixe edition 
J2ME -> micro edition

distrctur (Grabage collector -handle memory automatically);
no tamplate
haeder/maker file 
all classes by default inherated from a common ansistor known as  Object
Almost all data types are objects
helps us to develop front end of our application 
servlets
jsp jsf Applets
RMI remote method invocatin 
JVM (java virtual matchine) verifier  
why it is better : platform independent language
how to run program:
first.java -> compiler -> first.class -> interprater(jvm) ->execution
-multithreading : multipal program run at same time 
-multitasking:multipal aplication run at same time 
-memory management : garbage collector
-automatic memory management 
-secure
-robust (means run in any situation)
in java there are 2 thing error and exceptions
Errors: faulare of harddisk, power supply shutdown 
Exception : 2 types:
checked exceptions: 
-must be caught or decleared in throws clause
-compiler will issue an error if not handel it properly
unchecked exceptions:
-Subclasses of runtimeExecption and errors 
-do not required exception handling 
eg Null exception, divide with 0 exception
